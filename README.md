Description 

This is a Python script for a web application created using Streamlit for scraping Twitter data based on a given keyword or hashtag for a given time period. The script uses the snscrape package to scrape data from Twitter and stores the data in a pandas dataframe. The dataframe can be downloaded as a CSV or a JSON file, and the tweets can be uploaded to a MongoDB database.
